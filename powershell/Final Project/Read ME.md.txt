#This script will allow you to choose from 7 different options, as you will see blow. THis is an expansion of my first two scripts. I have integrated sub menu's and a pretty cool trick (option 6, make sure to enable telnet within windows!:

    Get Time
    Get Weather
    Get Uptime
    Get Disk Information
	Windows Update
	A New Hope
    Exit

#Running any of these commands will give the requested information as well as loop back to the beginning of the script, allowing you to choose a different option.

#You can run this script from powershell by navigating to the proper directory or by using the full path. #Simply type '.\final.ps1' when in the working directory.

The outputs would be what you'd expect:

Get Time - this will display the current system time 
Get Weather - connects to wttr.in for an in terminal weather experience 
Get Uptime - Displays how long the system has been running 
Get Disk Information - Displays the current disks installed on the system 
Get Windows Update - Gets Windows updates for your system and prompts you to install them.
A New Hope - This is pretty neat(enable telnet in windows)!
Exit - Exits the script

If a number that is not 1-7 is given an error is thrown saying "No matching option for #"
